# Reddit-Sentiment-Analysis
A full blown ML sentyment analysis  app and statistic generator fed with an automatic ETL pipleline deployed over configurable sub-reddits from the popular website "Reddit", the obtained elements being only comments. Used tools: NLTK, Django, Scipy, Pandas and Pytorch. The objective to accomplish here is to get some practice deploying ML models and to also get a better grasp over ETL fundamentals and web scraping. May also eventually build a very shitty front end for the generated analytics.

Currently: Batching data using the praw; will postpone the scraping feature due to time constraints.
